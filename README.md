# Cacao (CORS Access-Control-Allow-Origin) Proxy App

Cacao is a Cross-Origin (CORS) proxy.  It allows Javascript running in a web browser to access a remote HTTP resource without cross-origin restrictions.  It runs on several different platforms, and essentially works by adding a `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` header to an HTTP response.

This app is for iOS and Android to use as a local proxy for their builtin web browsers.  It is built with [Flutter](https://flutter.io/).

See [Cacao Proxy](https://github.com/michaelfig/cacao) for more details.
